# Insertion Sort
- Similar to Bubble/Select Sort
- Builds up gradually by creating a sorted half

- Select a side and make that the sorted side
- Swap the elements away from the insertion point

- Great case: Online algorithm, where data is already sorted and adding more data it, using insertion sort is great here.

## TC
O(N^2) - Worst
O(N) - Best case
